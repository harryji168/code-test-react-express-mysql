## Coding Challenge
The purpose of this project is to understand how you deliver code for a production system and
what we can expect if you were to become an employee. The code sample project is evaluated
for quality, not quantity.
Story:
As a Teacher, I need a webpage that displays the test scores for my students that have been
already entered into the system, with a way for me to over-ride and adjust those scores so that
I can easily review and curve marks for students as needed.

Story:
As a Teacher, I need a webpage that displays the test scores for my students that have been
already entered into the system, with a way for me to over-ride and adjust those scores so that
I can easily review and curve marks for students as needed.
Acceptance Criteria:
A/C 1: Create a web page in React/Node that uses a database to store test score results for a
class of 5 students. MySQL is preferred.
A/C 2: The left column of the webpage should display the names of all 5 students.
A/C 3: The right column contains input fields that displays the current test score values from
the database for each student.
A/C 4: The right column input fields allow the user (Teacher) to over-ride the current test score
in the database.
A/C 5: Below the left column is a row labeled “Average Score”, that presents the average of the
scores for the 5 students without server involvement.
A/C 6: The web page is web accessible.
A/C 7: The web page uses responsive design techniques. (We use Material UI but you are
welcome to use any design system / roll your own if you like.)
A few pointers:
• Write this in the style that you would submit for a production ready system.
• Stay within scope.
• Indicate how much time you spent on this exercise and if you did it on your own or if
you got help from someone else. (using Google or other search engine/technical
resource is fine.)
• It is requested that you do not share your code publicly, since we may use this project
for other candidates and do not want to influence them.
• The software that is submitted has no copyright ownership so you can do with it
whatever you want and so can we. Also, you have no liability, and we have no
liability. It’s just a programming exercise to get to know you. Have fun!
